TO DO LIST: 

[BUG]
1. TourService -> GetToursAsync method -> When getting all the Tours, if there's a Group with multiple Language objects, 
                  the GetToursAsync method returns on the first Language object. Similar issue with the Participants objects.  

[FEATURE]        
2. Filters -> Various filters need to be added i.e. find tour by Price range, find tour by Partner Name, etc. 

[FEATURE]
3. Calendar -> In the database, another table needs to be added which countais the TourID and the IDs of all the Suppliers
                           which are associated with that specific tour. In addition to that, the CRUD needs to be added as well. 

[FEATURE]
4. User management integration -> When creating a new tour, a "Get user Id" is needed which is the value of "CreatedBy" 
                                  in some tables in the database.
